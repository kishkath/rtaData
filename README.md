The severity of injury is based on various factors, such as 
 
* damages of collided vehicles(If the damage of collided vehicles are more, the injury would be serious)
* vehicle hit to a person (if vehicle hits directly to a person)
* Light Conditions(If its a full light condition, person would try to escape, if not he wont be able to escape and would stand over there and vehicle would hit straight)
* Age of person (If age is less, slight injuries would have occur, else serious)
* few more.
